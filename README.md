#weather-app
This is a simple HTML, CSS and Javascript program that lets you check the weather in real time. I made this because I want to challenge myself further and try making a program/project
using a different programming language and with the weather these days, I've been interested in making a weather app.

##Technologies used
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
OpenWeatherMap API

###Installation
Clone the repository or just download the project folder.
Open index.html in the files or go to VS Code or whatever IDE you're using and open the file in live server

####Usage
The weather can be viewed in our phone very easily but this application can be useful as well for those who wants a new interface and an interactive way to see the weather! Run the program
and just follow the instructions/prompt in the app. You can search for a country/city and the app will give you some useful information aside from just the actual weather of a place but 
also the temperature, humidity and wind speed.

#####Features
Search weather by country or city name.
Shows weather icons depending on the actual weather.
Displays temperature, humidity and wind speed.

#######Credits
I've watched a tutorial while doing this program, the link below is the Youtube video.

#########Lessons learned
I have learned how to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS and their basic syntax and conditional logic. I also learned how to build an actual interactive app/tool from scratch that can actually
help some users.
